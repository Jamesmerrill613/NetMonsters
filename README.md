# NetMonsters

Intial design and concept for a real-time Pokemon battling game/physics engine with particle based attacks and collisions. Frontend renders the game using THREE.js, backend pulls data from pokeapi.co and compiles player objects. 

Once the engine is stable and features for Pokemon health and move options are set up, each player will be pared with a neural net using BRAIN.js and trained to make competent choices in battle. Custom networks will be saved and loaded from the back end giving multiple networks the change to compete with one another.
